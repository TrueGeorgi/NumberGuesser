In NumberGuesser the computer will randomly select a number between 1 and 100, which the player must try to guess. He may choose between two difficulties. Limited moves or no limit to the guesses. If the player chooses the limited version, then he will randomly get a number of guesses between 3 and 7. At the end of the game, he can play the same version one more time if he wants to.

## Inputs and Outputs
Choose a number between 1 and 100. The computer will allow you to select a number up to 999. If the guessed number is incorrect, the computer will point the player out if the number he have selected is greater or lower than he number the player is looking for.
